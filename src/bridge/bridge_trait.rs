/// Common trait interface for CCTP bridge implementations (v1 and v2)
///
/// This trait provides shared functionality for bridging USDC across chains using
/// Circle's Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol. It covers chain configuration and
/// message extraction that are common to both protocol versions.
///
/// # Attestation Fetching
///
/// Attestation fetching is **not** part of this trait because V1 and V2 use
/// fundamentally different APIs:
///
/// - **V1**: `Cctp::get_attestation(message_hash)` - looks up by message hash
/// - **V2**: `CctpV2::get_attestation(tx_hash)` - looks up by transaction hash
///
/// This design ensures compile-time type safety: you can't accidentally pass
/// the wrong query type to the wrong bridge version.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use cctp_rs::{Cctp, CctpV2Bridge};
///
/// // V1 bridge - get attestation by message hash
/// let (message, message_hash) = v1_bridge.get_message_sent_event(tx_hash).await?;
/// let attestation = v1_bridge.get_attestation(message_hash, None, None).await?;
///
/// // V2 bridge - get attestation by transaction hash
/// let attestation = v2_bridge.get_attestation(tx_hash, None, None).await?;
/// ```
// `async_trait` generates a must-use future; nightly clippy can flag that
// generated attribute as redundant even though this trait does not add one.
