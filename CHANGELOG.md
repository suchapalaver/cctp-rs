# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [5.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- New `api_url_override: Option<Url>` builder field on `Cctp` and
  `CctpV2`. When set, `api_url()` returns the override unchanged;
  when unset, the existing mainnet/testnet selection over
  `IRIS_API` / `IRIS_API_SANDBOX` is preserved. Lets callers point
  the attestation polling loop at a custom Iris-compatible endpoint
  (e.g. a self-hosted mirror or a local mock) without forking the
  crate. Non-breaking — existing builders compile unchanged.

### Fixed

- Per-attempt and per-response inner spans
  (`cctp_rs.get_attestation`, `cctp_rs.process_attestation_response`)
  now carry the `error.type`, `error.message`, `error.context`, and
  `otel.status_code` fields that `record_error_with_context` writes
  for `HttpRequestFailed`, `AttestationFailed`,
  `AttestationDataMissing`, and `MessageDataMissing`. Previous
  versions omitted these field declarations at span creation, so
  `tracing::Span::record` silently dropped the writes — TraceQL
  queries like `{ span.error.type = "AttestationDataMissing" }`
  returned zero hits even while the SDK was emitting the errors in
  production. Operators relying on inner-span error attributes for
  alerting will now see matches.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- OpenTelemetry traces no longer attribute events from unrelated async
  tasks to CCTP attestation and message-extraction spans. Previous
  versions held a `Span::enter()` guard live across `.await` points
  inside `Cctp::get_attestation`, `Cctp::get_message_sent_event`, and
  their v2 counterparts; in async Rust that leaves the span "current"
  on the executor thread after the future yields, so events emitted
  by other tasks landed under attestation spans and made production
  traces misleading. The affected futures now attach their span via
  `tracing::Instrument`, which correctly enters on poll and exits on
  yield. The retry-loop demo in `examples/complete_bridge_trace.rs`
  was updated to the same shape.

### Changed

- `cctp_rs::spans` module documentation no longer demonstrates the
  unsafe `let _guard = span.enter();` pattern for async work. The
  module-level example uses `tracing::Instrument`, and the
  `record_error` / `record_error_with_context` doctests note that the
  entered-guard pattern shown is for synchronous scopes only.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-05-19

### Changed

- Updated alloy dependencies — `alloy-primitives` and `alloy-sol-types`
  from 1.5 to 1.6, and the workspace 2.0.x crates (`alloy-contract`,
  `alloy-json-rpc`, `alloy-network`, `alloy-provider`, `alloy-rpc-types`,
  `alloy-transport`, dev-only `alloy-signer-local`) from 2.0.4 to 2.0.5.
  No source changes required; semver-compatible for callers on alloy
  1.x / 2.0.x.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- New `AttestationFailureKind` enum (`#[non_exhaustive]`) with three
  variants — `ApiReportedFailed`, `AttestationMissing`,
  `MessageMissing` — exposed at the crate root. Lets callers
  `match` on a specific attestation-poll failure mode instead of
  substring-matching on a free-form `reason` string.

- New `CctpError::TransactionNotFound { tx_hash }` variant signals
  that the source-chain RPC returned no receipt for the given
  hash (likely not yet mined or not indexed by the queried node).
  The hash is carried on the variant so callers can log or retry
  without parsing it out of a message string.

- New `CctpError::MessageSentEventMissing { tx_hash }` variant
  signals that the receipt was found but did not contain the
  CCTP `MessageSent` log — typically because the call hit the
  wrong contract or reverted before reaching the burn step. Also
  carries the `tx_hash`.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `CctpError::AttestationFailed` is now a tuple variant
  carrying `AttestationFailureKind`
  (`AttestationFailed(AttestationFailureKind)`) instead of the
  struct variant `AttestationFailed { reason: String }`. The five
  internal construction sites in `bridge/cctp.rs` and
  `bridge/v2.rs` collapse onto three named cases. The `Display`
  output changes from the prior free-text `reason` to a fixed
  prose phrase per kind (`Attestation failed: Iris API reported
  failed status`, `... attestation field missing in complete
  response`, or `... message field missing in complete response`);
  telemetry that scraped the prior strings should switch to
  matching on the typed kind.

- **Breaking**: `CctpError::InvalidUrl` is now a tuple variant
  carrying `url::ParseError` (`InvalidUrl(url::ParseError)`) instead
  of the struct variant `InvalidUrl { reason: String }`. Callers
  that destructured `{ reason }` must switch to tuple-pattern
  matching. The new shape exposes the structured parse error
  (kind, position) for diagnostics; the `Display` output retains
  the `Invalid URL: <details>` shape, though the per-call-site
  prefix (`Failed to construct attestation URL:` /
  `Failed to construct v2 messages URL:`) is no longer included.

### Removed

- **Breaking**: `CctpError::Provider(String)` has been removed.
  Callers that constructed `Provider(...)` directly should switch
  to `Rpc(...)` (which accepts `RpcError<TransportErrorKind>` via
  `From`) for transport errors, or `Contract(...)` for typed
  contract-call errors.

- **Breaking**: `CctpError::TransactionFailed { reason: String }`
  has been removed. Its three internal construction patterns now
  flow through typed variants: RPC-fetch failures propagate
  through `CctpError::Rpc` via the existing `#[from]` impl; the
  "receipt missing" case routes to the new `TransactionNotFound
  { tx_hash }`; the "MessageSent log absent" case routes to the
  new `MessageSentEventMissing { tx_hash }`. Callers that
  destructured `TransactionFailed { reason }` for substring
  matching should switch to matching the typed variants directly.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- New `CctpError::Contract(alloy_contract::Error)` variant preserves
  alloy's structured contract-call error so callers can use
  `alloy_contract::Error::as_revert_data` and
  `as_decoded_interface_error` for revert decoding without re-parsing
  Display strings. Bridge call sites that previously stringified
  contract errors via `CctpError::ContractCall(format!(...))` now
  propagate the typed variant through `?`, and `is_already_relayed`
  inspects the underlying `TransportError` payload directly.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `CctpError` is now `#[non_exhaustive]`. Downstream
  matches must include a wildcard arm. In return, future variant
  additions to `CctpError` will be non-breaking — `DomainId` already
  follows this pattern.
- **Breaking**: `CctpError::ContractCall(String)` has been removed.
  All internal call sites now use the typed `Contract(alloy_contract::Error)`
  variant; callers that constructed `ContractCall` for their own
  contract-call paths should switch to `Contract` (which accepts an
  `alloy_contract::Error` directly via `From`) or to `Provider(String)`
  for non-alloy contract code.

### Removed

- **Breaking**: `batch_token_checks`, deprecated in 3.3.0, has been
  removed. Use `batch_token_state` instead — it returns the same
  values inside a `TokenState` with named fields and predicate
  helpers (`can_transfer`, `needs_approval`, `has_sufficient_balance`).

### Fixed

- `CctpError::is_already_relayed` now detects already-relayed reverts
  on contract calls consistently. The previous implementation only
  matched the legacy `ContractCall(String)` variant, so a revert
  surfaced through alloy's typed error path was missed and the bridge
  helpers reported a hard failure instead of recognizing the message
  as already delivered.

### Internal

- Dropped a dead type-erasing fallback in `is_already_relayed`: only
  `alloy_contract::Error::TransportError` carries chain-level revert
  data, so the other variants now answer `false` directly rather than
  being stringified through pattern matching.
- Refactored bridge and example error handling to use `?` with span-
  based error context instead of repeated `map_err` + `format!`
  bridges.
- Examples now read USDC balances via the public `Erc20Contract` API
  and parallelize the four pre-flight balance reads with
  `tokio::join!`. ETH balance reads were aligned with the same
  span-based `?` idiom.
- Added regression tests covering `is_already_relayed` against both
  the typed `ContractNotDeployed` variant (no revert payload) and an
  RPC `ErrorPayload` carrying a revert message.
- Documentation: clarified why BNB Smart Chain is excluded from CCTP
  v2 (USYC-only on domain 17) and removed stale TODOs; spelled out
  the threshold semantics of `TokenState::has_sufficient_balance`.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-05-06

### Deprecated

- `batch_token_checks` is deprecated in favor of `batch_token_state`.
  The new helper returns a typed `TokenState` with `can_transfer`,
  `needs_approval`, and `has_sufficient_balance` predicates instead of
  a positional `(allowance, balance)` tuple, eliminating the field-order
  hazard between the two return shapes. `batch_token_checks` continues to
  work and now delegates to `batch_token_state`; callers will see a
  `#[deprecated]` warning steering them to the new API.

### Changed

- Module-level rustdoc and the `AGENTS.md` helper table now lead with
  `batch_token_state` so new code reaches for the predicate API first.
- `batch_token_state` holds the join logic and error mapping that
  `batch_token_checks` previously duplicated; both now share a single
  implementation.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- `InvalidDomainId` and `InvalidFinalityThreshold` are now re-exported
  from the crate root. Consumers of `DomainId::try_from(u32)` and
  `FinalityThreshold::try_from(u32)` can name the error types directly
  to match on them, propagate them, or wrap them in their own error
  enums without piercing private module paths. Closes #175.

### Changed

- Accessor methods on `FinalityThreshold` and `DomainId` now carry
  `#[must_use]`, so dropping a return value triggers a lint at the
  call site instead of silently discarding the result.
- `InvalidDomainId` and `InvalidFinalityThreshold` now derive
  `thiserror::Error` to match `CctpError`'s style. The `Display`
  message format and `std::error::Error` impl are unchanged — purely
  an internal cleanup.
- The `Default for FinalityThreshold` doc comment no longer restates
  the impl signature; the rationale ("Standard transfers have no fees
  and are the safest option") is now the lead. Closes #176.

## [3.1.2] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- Crate metadata now names the actual problem space — `description` mentions
  USDC, Circle, CCTP v1/v2, and bridging; `keywords` are the specific terms
  agents and users search for (`cctp`, `usdc`, `circle`, `bridge`, `alloy`)
  rather than generic `defi`/`web3` filler. Improves crates.io discoverability.
- Module-level rustdoc on `lib.rs` now opens with a `Choosing an API` table
  that points readers to `CctpV2Bridge` (recommended), `Cctp` (legacy v1-only
  chains), `mint_if_needed` / `wait_for_receive`, and the v2 message
  inspection types. The V2 Quick Start now appears before the V1 Quick Start.
- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical agent-facing guide; `CLAUDE.md` points to it
  to prevent drift. Adds a v1-vs-v2 decision matrix, a footguns section
  (zeroed v2 nonces, permissionless relayer races, bytes32 recipient padding,
  mainnet/testnet Iris hosts), and a public-API map keyed to source.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-05-05

### Changed

- `batch_token_checks` no longer emits its own `debug!`/`info!` records.
  The inner `Erc20Contract::allowance` and `balance_of` calls already log
  every read, so each batch was producing three duplicate `info!` entries
  per call. Log volume for callers using the batch helper is reduced
  accordingly; structured fields and event names from the inner ERC20
  layer are unchanged.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- `record_error_with_context` now actually populates `error.context` on the
  top-level bridge operation spans. The field was previously written to spans
  that did not declare it, making the call a silent no-op.

### Changed

- **Observability schema (breaking for dashboards/alerts)**:
  - Renamed the span field `error.source` to `error.context` on
    `cctp_rs.get_message_sent_event`, `cctp_rs.get_attestation_with_retry`,
    `cctp_rs.get_v2_attestation_with_retry`, and `cctp_rs.deposit_for_burn`.
  - Renamed the v2 attestation polling span from
    `cctp_rs.get_attestation_with_retry` to
    `cctp_rs.get_v2_attestation_with_retry`, and dropped the
    `version = "v2"` attribute (the span name now disambiguates).
  - `record_error` now sets `error.type` to `std::any::type_name::<E>()`
    rather than the first colon-delimited fragment of the Display string.
- **Span helper API**:
  - `spans::send_transaction` now takes `tx_hash: TxHash` instead of
    `tx_hash: &str`, matching the typing used by the other span helpers.
- Switched `message_hash` span attributes to `FixedBytes<32>`'s `Display`
  impl (output now includes the `0x` prefix) and removed `#[inline]` from
  the trivial span constructors.

### Internal

- Documented why v1 and v2 attestation-retry spans require separate
  constructors (`tracing::info_span!` field identifiers must be literals).
- Fixed a typo in the module-level rustdoc example (`poll intervali`).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Upgraded the alloy workspace crates (`alloy-contract`,
  `alloy-json-rpc`, `alloy-network`, `alloy-provider`, `alloy-rpc-types`,
  `alloy-transport`, and the dev-only `alloy-signer-local`) from 1.7 to 2.0.
  The cctp-rs source does not use any of the APIs broken by alloy 2.0
  (`GasFiller` unit struct, split `TransactionBuilder` trait, blob-tx
  builder reshuffle, strict `AnyNetwork` signing, exhaustive `ChainConfig`
  matches), so migration is transparent for callers who only depend on
  cctp-rs. Callers who also depend on alloy directly must upgrade their
  alloy dependency to 2.0 in the same step.
- Scoped `dotenvy` to dev-dependencies so it is no longer resolved
  transitively by downstream consumers.

### Removed

- Unused `alloy-dyn-abi` root dependency was dropped — no public API
  impact, but shrinks the dependency surface resolved by downstream.

### Fixed

- Pulled in `rustls-webpki` 0.103.12 via a lockfile refresh to resolve
  RUSTSEC-2026-0098 (name constraints for URI names incorrectly accepted)
  and RUSTSEC-2026-0099 (name constraints accepted for certificates
  asserting a wildcard name).

### Security

- Kept the advisory baseline clean: only the pre-existing transitive
  `derivative` (RUSTSEC-2024-0388) and `paste` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)
  unmaintained-crate warnings remain, both tracked consistently in
  `deny.toml` and `.cargo/audit.toml`.

### Internal

- Extracted cargo-deny policy from the security workflow heredoc into a
  repo-root `deny.toml`, so contributors can reproduce CI's license and
  advisory checks locally.
- Modernized GitHub Actions workflows to use `Swatinem/rust-cache` for
  Rust-aware caching and `taiki-e/install-action` to install
  `cargo-audit`, `cargo-deny`, and `cargo-semver-checks` from prebuilt
  binaries instead of compiling from source on every run.
- Removed the dependabot ignore rule for alloy semver-major updates so
  future breaking alloy releases surface as reviewable PRs.
- Applied pedantic clippy cleanups (named format-string interpolation,
  `u64::from` in place of `as u64` for widening conversions, type and
  event names in rustdoc backticks).

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Agent/tooling-friendly CCTP v2 message inspection API:
  - `ParsedV2Message` for structured decoding of canonical Circle v2 messages
  - `ParsedV2MessageSummary` for JSON-friendly summaries suitable for tool outputs
  - Header helpers for nonce inspection, permissionless relay detection, address extraction, and finality interpretation
  - Burn message body encode/decode helpers for round-tripping canonical transfer payloads
- New `ParseMessageError` type for v2 message parsing failures without changing the existing bridge/runtime error surface

### Changed

- Enabled `serde` support on agent-facing public types including:
  - `PollingConfig`
  - `MintResult`
  - `AttestationResponse`, `V2AttestationResponse`, `V2Message`, `AttestationStatus`
  - `DomainId` and `FinalityThreshold`
  - `MessageHeader` and `BurnMessageV2`
- Expanded README and crate docs with agent-tooling guidance for turning canonical Circle v2 messages into structured JSON
- Avoided redundant message re-encoding in `ParsedV2Message::summary()` when computing both hash and length

### Fixed

- Preserved semver compatibility for `2.x` by keeping `CctpError` unchanged and isolating parser failures in `ParseMessageError`
- Documented forward-compatibility expectations for `DomainId` serde values and clarified that the current address helpers use EVM `bytes32` address conventions

---

## [2.1.4] - 2026-03-21

### Security

- Fixed RUSTSEC-2026-0044, RUSTSEC-2026-0048 (AWS-LC X.509/CRL vulnerabilities) by updating aws-lc-sys to 0.39.0
- Fixed RUSTSEC-2026-0049 (CRL distribution point matching) by updating rustls-webpki to 0.103.10

### Changed

### Changed

- Updated alloy dependencies from 1.4 to 1.6

---

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-19

---

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Typed error detection methods** on `CctpError` for robust error handling:
  - `is_already_relayed()`: Detect when a CCTP message was already relayed by a third party
  - `is_timeout()`: Check for timeout errors (attestation or network)
  - `is_rate_limited()`: Detect HTTP 429 rate limiting responses
  - `is_transient()`: Identify retriable errors (timeouts, rate limits, network issues)

- **Batch token check helpers** for parallel RPC calls:
  - `batch_token_checks()`: Fetch allowance and balance concurrently using `tokio::join!`
  - `batch_token_state()`: Returns structured `TokenState` with helper methods
  - `TokenState` struct with `can_transfer()`, `needs_approval()`, `has_sufficient_balance()`

- **Provider utilities** for gas estimation and configuration:
  - `estimate_gas_with_buffer()`: Gas estimation with configurable safety buffer (default 20%)
  - `calculate_gas_price_with_buffer()`: EIP-1559 gas price calculation with tip buffer
  - `ProviderConfig` struct with presets: `fast_transfer()`, `high_reliability()`, `rate_limited()`

- **Production retry documentation** with patterns for throttle usage and custom retry logic

### Changed

- Refactored `mint_if_needed()` to use typed `is_already_relayed()` instead of string matching

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `Option<u32>, Option<u64>` parameters in `get_attestation()` with `PollingConfig` struct
  - Before: `bridge.get_attestation(hash, Some(20), Some(30)).await?`
  - After: `bridge.get_attestation(hash, PollingConfig::default().with_max_attempts(20).with_poll_interval_secs(30)).await?`

### Added

- New `PollingConfig` struct for self-documenting attestation polling configuration
  - `PollingConfig::default()` - Standard v1 transfers (30 attempts, 60s intervals)
  - `PollingConfig::fast_transfer()` - Optimized for v2 fast transfers (30 attempts, 5s intervals)
  - Builder methods: `with_max_attempts()`, `with_poll_interval_secs()`
  - Helper method: `total_timeout_secs()` to calculate maximum wait time

### Migration Guide

```rust
// V1 - Before (1.x)
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(message_hash, None, None).await?;
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(message_hash, Some(20), Some(30)).await?;

// V1 - After (2.0)
use cctp_rs::PollingConfig;
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(message_hash, PollingConfig::default()).await?;
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(
    message_hash,
    PollingConfig::default()
        .with_max_attempts(20)
        .with_poll_interval_secs(30),
).await?;

// V2 - Before (1.x)
let (message, attestation) = bridge.get_attestation(tx_hash, None, None).await?;

// V2 - After (2.0)
let (message, attestation) = bridge.get_attestation(
    tx_hash,
    PollingConfig::fast_transfer(),  // or PollingConfig::default() for standard
).await?;
```

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-26

### Changed

- Removed unused chain confirmation configuration from bridge config module
  - Removed `DEFAULT_CONFIRMATION_TIMEOUT` constant
  - Removed `CHAIN_CONFIRMATION_CONFIG` constant
  - Removed `get_chain_confirmation_config()` function
  - These were dead code (marked with `#[allow(dead_code)]`) and never called
  - The SDK correctly delegates finality validation to Circle's attestation service

---

## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-25

### Summary

**First stable release!** This release marks production-readiness with comprehensive CCTP v1 and v2 support, 155 passing tests, and zero clippy warnings.

### Highlights

- **Full CCTP v1/v2 Protocol Support**: Type-safe interfaces for both protocol versions
- **Relayer-Aware API**: Graceful handling of permissionless relay model with `MintResult` enum
- **Production Observability**: Comprehensive OpenTelemetry instrumentation
- **Robust Error Handling**: Consolidated error types with HTTP client timeouts

### Added

- HTTP client timeout (30 seconds) to prevent indefinite hangs on network issues

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Consolidated duplicate error variants - removed `ChainNotSupported { chain: String }`, keeping only `UnsupportedChain(NamedChain)` for type safety and zero allocation

### Fixed

- Error handling now uses consistent, type-safe error variants throughout

---

## [0.16.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added

- **Relayer-Aware API for CCTP v2**: New methods to gracefully handle the permissionless relay model
  - `MintResult` enum: Distinguishes between `Minted(TxHash)` (we relayed) and `AlreadyRelayed` (third party completed)
  - `is_message_received()`: Query on-chain nonce status to check if transfer is complete
  - `wait_for_receive()`: Poll until transfer completes (by relayer or self), with configurable attempts and interval
  - `mint_if_needed()`: Conservative mint strategy that checks status first, avoiding wasted gas on races

- **AlreadyRelayed Error Variant**: New `CctpError::AlreadyRelayed` for explicit race condition handling

### Documentation

- Added "Relayer-Aware Patterns (V2)" section to README with three usage patterns:
  - Option A: Wait for completion (recommended for most use cases)
  - Option B: Self-relay with graceful race handling
  - Option C: Manual status checking

## [0.15.0] - 2025-11-25

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced `confirmation_average_time_seconds()` in `CctpV2` trait with two explicit methods:
  - `fast_transfer_confirmation_time_seconds()` - Returns attestation times with Fast Transfer enabled (5-20 seconds)
  - `standard_transfer_confirmation_time_seconds()` - Returns attestation times for Standard Transfer (5 seconds to 8 hours)

### Fixed

- Fixed v2 `CctpV2` trait returning block production times instead of Circle attestation times
  - Previously returned 1-12 seconds (block times)
  - Now returns actual attestation confirmation times based on Circle's documentation
  - Fast Transfer: Ethereum 20s, most chains 8s, high-perf chains 5s
  - Standard Transfer: Ethereum/L2s 19min, Avalanche 20s, Polygon 8min, Linea 8hrs

### Migration Guide

```rust
// Before (0.14.0)
let time = chain.confirmation_average_time_seconds()?; // Returned block times (wrong!)

// After (0.15.0)
// Choose based on your transfer mode:
let time = chain.fast_transfer_confirmation_time_seconds()?;     // Fast Transfer
let time = chain.standard_transfer_confirmation_time_seconds()?; // Standard (default)
```

## [0.14.0] - 2025-11-25

### Added

- **ERC20 Contract Wrapper**: New `Erc20Contract` for token approval and allowance operations
  - `approve()` for granting token spending permission before CCTP burns
  - `allowance()` for checking current approval amounts
  - Essential for the complete CCTP transfer workflow
  - Exposed publicly for direct use

- **Public Chain Addresses Module**: Exposed `chain::addresses` module for accessing contract addresses directly

- **V2-specific span function**: Added `get_v2_attestation_with_retry` for proper v2 observability with `TxHash` instead of message hash

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Simplified attestation API with type-safe methods per version
  - V1 `Cctp`: `get_attestation(message_hash, ...)` - takes message hash directly
  - V2 `CctpV2`: `get_attestation(tx_hash, ...)` - takes transaction hash directly
  - Removed `AttestationQuery` enum in favor of compile-time type safety
  - Method signatures now clearly indicate what parameters are needed

- **BREAKING**: V2 `get_attestation()` now returns `(Vec<u8>, AttestationBytes)` instead of just `AttestationBytes`
  - Always returns both the canonical message and attestation from Circle's API
  - Eliminates foot-gun where users might use wrong message for minting
  - The `MessageSent` event log contains zeros in the nonce field; Circle fills this in before signing

- **BREAKING**: Removed `get_attestation_with_message()` from V2 - use `get_attestation()` instead

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: Removed `BridgeParams` from public API (was unused)

### Fixed

- Fixed v2 API path: renamed constant to `MESSAGES_PATH_V2` reflecting the actual endpoint format
- V2 now correctly uses `/v2/messages/{domain}?transactionHash={tx}` format
- Fixed critical v2 attestation bug: MessageSent event contains template message with zero nonce; now always uses canonical message from Circle's API

### Migration Guide

```rust
// V1 - Before (0.13.0)
bridge.get_attestation(AttestationQuery::by_message_hash(hash), max_attempts, poll_interval).await?;

// V1 - After (0.14.0)
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(hash, None, None).await?;

// V2 - Before (0.13.0)
let attestation = bridge.get_attestation(tx_hash, None, None).await?;
let (message, _hash) = bridge.get_message_sent_event(tx_hash).await?; // BUG: wrong message!

// V2 - After (0.14.0)
let (message, attestation) = bridge.get_attestation(tx_hash, None, None).await?;
// Now use `message` (canonical from Circle API) for minting - this is the correct message!
```

## [0.13.0] - 2025-01-24

### Added

- **v1 MessageTransmitterContract**: Exposed `MessageTransmitterContract` in the public API
  - `receive_message_transaction()` for receiving cross-chain messages with attestation
  - `is_nonce_used()` for checking anti-replay protection
  - Matches v2 API symmetry for consistent developer experience

### Changed

- Removed unnecessary `#[allow(dead_code)]` attributes from public contract wrappers
  - Applies to `TokenMessengerContract`, `MessageTransmitterContract` (v1)
  - Applies to `TokenMessengerV2Contract`, `MessageTransmitterV2Contract` (v2)

## [0.11.0] - 2025-01-24

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replaced primitive domain ID types with strongly-typed `DomainId` enum
  - Domain IDs are now type-safe with compile-time validation
  - Added `DomainId::from_u32()`, `DomainId::as_u32()`, `DomainId::name()`, and `Display` trait support
  - Improved API ergonomics with meaningful type names instead of raw integers
- Reorganized crate into conceptual modules for better code organization
  - Split code into logical modules: `bridge`, `chain`, `contracts`, `protocol`, and `spans`
  - Improved maintainability and discoverability of functionality
- Updated all Cargo dependencies to latest versions

### Added

- Enhanced OpenTelemetry instrumentation with comprehensive error tracking
  - Added structured error recording with full context preservation
  - Improved observability for debugging production issues
  - Better span hierarchy for cross-chain transfer tracing

## [0.10.1] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed

- **CRITICAL**: Fixed deserialization failure when Circle's Iris API returns `"attestation": "PENDING"` as a string instead of `null`
  - Added custom deserializer that gracefully handles the "PENDING" string by treating it as `None`
  - This fixes production crashes on Arbitrum and other chains where attestation polling would fail with: `JSON error: invalid value: string "PENDING", expected a valid hex string`
  - Enhanced error logging to include raw response body, message hash, and attempt number for better debugging
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for all attestation response formats (valid hex, "PENDING" string, null, empty string, missing field)
  - No breaking changes to public API

### Documentation

- Documented Circle API quirk where attestation field may be "PENDING" instead of null
- Added inline comments explaining the custom deserializer workaround

## [0.10.0] - 2024-11-16

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Minimized public API surface for improved semver stability
  - Reduced from 30+ exports to 6 core types: `AttestationBytes`, `AttestationResponse`, `AttestationStatus`, `BridgeParams`, `Cctp`, `CctpV1`, `CctpError`, `Result`
  - Removed public exports of domain ID constants, contract address constants, and internal configuration
  - Internal modules (`domain_id`, `message_transmitter`, `token_messenger`) remain accessible via trait methods
- **BREAKING**: Made `BridgeParams` fields private (public getter methods remain available)
- **BREAKING**: Made `TokenMessengerContract.instance` field private
- Refactored `bridge.rs` (589 lines) into clean submodules (`bridge/cctp.rs`, `bridge/params.rs`, `bridge/config.rs`)
