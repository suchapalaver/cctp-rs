## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the highest standards of professional conduct. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Submit a pull request

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75.0 or later
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cctp-rs.git
cd cctp-rs

# Install dependencies
cargo build

# Run tests to ensure everything works
cargo test
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-new-chain-support`
- `fix/attestation-timeout-bug`
- `docs/improve-examples`

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

- `feat: add support for Polygon chain`
- `fix: resolve attestation polling timeout`
- `docs: improve README examples`
- `test: add integration tests for Base chain`

## Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage. Please ensure:

1. **Unit Tests**: Add tests for all new functionality

```bash
cargo test
```

2. **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end flows when applicable

3. **Documentation Tests**: Ensure all code examples in docs work

```bash
cargo test --doc
```

4. **Examples**: Verify examples compile and run

```bash
cargo build --examples
```

### Test Guidelines

- Write clear, descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Use `rstest` for parameterized tests
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

## Code Style

### Formatting

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run clippy with strict settings
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with clear examples
- Use `///` for documentation comments
- Include usage examples in module-level docs
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

### Rust Guidelines

- Follow Rust API guidelines
- Use `Result<T, CctpError>` for error handling
- Prefer explicit error types over `anyhow`
- Use the `?` operator for error propagation
- Follow naming conventions (snake_case for functions, PascalCase for types)

## Submitting Changes

Do not push directly to `main` for routine work. All maintenance, dependency,
documentation, and release-prep changes should go through a branch and pull
request so required reviews and status checks run before merge. Emergency
bypasses should be explicit maintainer actions and should leave an issue or PR
comment describing what was bypassed and why.

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**: Ensure README, docs, and examples reflect your changes
2. **Add Tests**: Include comprehensive tests for new functionality
3. **Run CI Locally**: Ensure all checks pass
4. **Fill PR Template**: Provide thorough description of changes
5. **Link Issues**: Reference any related issues

### PR Requirements

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is properly formatted (`cargo fmt`)
- [ ] No clippy warnings (`cargo clippy`)
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Examples work correctly
- [ ] Breaking changes are clearly documented

### Review Process

- PRs require review before merging
- Address reviewer feedback promptly
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
- Squash commits before merging if requested

## Chain Support

When adding support for new chains:

1. **Research**: Verify CCTP deployment addresses
2. **Domain IDs**: Confirm correct domain IDs from Circle documentation
3. **Testing**: Test against both mainnet and testnet deployments
4. **Documentation**: Update chain support documentation
5. **Examples**: Add chain to multi-chain examples

### Required Information for New Chains

- Chain name and ID
- CCTP domain ID
- TokenMessenger contract address
- MessageTransmitter contract address
- Average confirmation time
- RPC endpoints for testing

## Security

### Security Guidelines

- Never commit private keys, mnemonics, or API keys
- Validate all user inputs
- Use secure random number generation
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Report security vulnerabilities privately

### Responsible Disclosure

For security vulnerabilities:

1. **Do not** create public issues
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Allow time for fixes before disclosure
4. Follow coordinated disclosure timeline

## CCTP Protocol Knowledge

Contributors should understand:

- [Circle's CCTP documentation](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/cctp-protocol)
